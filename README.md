Description: In this project the goal of displaying a normal distribution to visually prove that a hypothesis is true. I use the NumPy Python  Library, to set a random seed generator that store random numbers of the dataset representing the whole population. I then used what was generated by utilizing matplotlib to visually display a normal distribution plot.

Description: In this project I imported and inspected a Zip code data set containing 4,684 zip code(s).I utilized Pandas Python Library to analyze the data in a CSV file that contained plain text and is a well know format that can be read by Pandas. Since my data sets are stored in a file, Pandas loads them into a DataFrame. I also utilized Matplotlib to plot the Pandas data as a visualization utility.
